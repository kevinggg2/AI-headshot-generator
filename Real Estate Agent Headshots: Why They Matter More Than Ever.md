## 1. Your Headshot Builds Trust in Seconds

Real estate is a relationship business. Buyers and sellers are looking for someone they can trust with one of the biggest transactions of their lives. According to a study by [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201601/the-power-first-impressions), people form impressions in milliseconds, and a warm, approachable photo helps make that instant connection.

A **professional real estate headshot** conveys:

- Trustworthiness  
- Competence  
- Confidence  
- Approachability

## 2. Good Real Estate Agent Headshots Boost Click-Through Rates

Whether you're on Zillow, Realtor.com, or even your own brokerage website, prospective clients are scrolling through lists of agents. An eye-catching, polished headshot makes people stop and click.

> According to HubSpot, listings with high-quality images (including agent headshots) receive up to **94% more views** than those without.

## 3. Consistency Across Platforms Builds a Memorable Brand

As a real estate professional, your photo appears across multiple platforms:

- LinkedIn  
- Instagram
